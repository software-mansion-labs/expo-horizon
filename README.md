This is a fork of some of the `expo` packages which adds a support for Meta horizon devices. It includes an `expo-horizon-core` common library to prepare your app for Meta horizon devices.

## Included Packages

- [`expo-horizon-core`](expo-horizon-core/README.md) - for building Expo applications for Meta horizon devices
- [`expo-horizon-location`](expo-horizon-location/README.md) - for location services on Meta horizon devices
- [`expo-horizon-notifications`](expo-horizon-notifications/README.md) - for push notifications on Meta horizon devices

## Get Started

To get started with developing for Meta horizon devices, you should first add the `expo-horizon-core` package to your project. See the [expo-horizon-core README](expo-horizon-core/README.md) for installation instructions and config plugin configuration.

Then you can add additional packages as needed for location services and notifications.

## Example App
