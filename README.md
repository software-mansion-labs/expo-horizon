# expo-quest

This is a fork of some of the `expo` packages which adds a support for Meta Quest devices. It includes an expo-quest common library to prepare your app for Meta Quest devices.

## Included packages

- [`expo-quest`](expo-quest/README.md) - for building Expo applications for Meta Quest devices
- [`expo-quest-location`](expo-quest-location/README.md) - for location services on Meta Quest devices
- [`expo-quest-notifications`](expo-quest-notifications/README.md) - for push notifications on Meta Quest devices

## Get Started

To get started with developing for Meta Quest devices, you should first add the `expo-quest` package to your project. See the [expo-quest README](expo-quest/README.md) for installation instructions and config plugin configuration.

Then you can add additional packages as needed for location services and notifications.

## Example app

- [`example`](example/README.md) - an example app that uses the included packages
