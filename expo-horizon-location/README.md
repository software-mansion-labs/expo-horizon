# expo-horizon-location

![expo-horizon-location](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/expo-horizon-location.svg)

A fork of [`expo-location`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-location) that provides two implementations:

- The default `expo-location` behavior using Google Play Services.
- A Meta Horizon‚Äìcompatible implementation that does not rely on Google Play Services.

You can choose which implementation to use with the `quest` / `mobile` build variants. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details. This makes it compatible with Meta Horizon devices, while remaining a drop-in replacement for `expo-location` on Android and iOS.

## Prerequisites

- Expo SDK 54 or later (`expo` package version 54.0.13+)
- `expo-horizon-core` package installed. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details

## Usage

1. Install the `expo-horizon-core` package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-horizon-core
```

2. Install the package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-horizon-location

# and remove the old package:
npm uninstall expo-location
# or
yarn remove expo-location
```

3. Update your `app.json` / `app.config.js` to replace `expo-location` with `expo-horizon-location`.
4. Use the `questDebug` / `questRelease` build variants to run the app on Meta Quest devices. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details.
5. Update your imports:

```js
import * as Location from 'expo-horizon-location';
```

## Behavior

- On Meta Quest devices ‚Üí Uses the Meta Horizon‚Äìcompatible push notification service.
- On standard Android devices ‚Üí Falls back to the default `expo-location` behavior using Google Play Services.
- On iOS it should have no effect; behavior is always the same as `expo-location`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `quest` build variants are intended specifically for Meta Quest devices. Using them on standard Android devices is not recommended, as certain features may be unsupported or behave differently.

## Additional features

You might need additional features like `isHorizonDevice` or `isHorizonBuild` to check if the device is a Meta Horizon device. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details.

## Features supported on Meta Horizon OS

## Version compatibility

Our goal is to align the version numbers of `expo-horizon-location` and `expo-location` for easier upgrades. However, since this fork is still under development, we are currently using a separate versioning scheme.

| `expo-horizon-location` | `expo-location` |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 0.0.3                   | 18.1.17         |
