# expo-horizon-notifications

A fork of [`expo-notifications`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-notifications) that provides two implementations:

- The default `expo-notifications` for Android and iOS platforms.
- A Meta Horizon‚Äìcompatible implementation that uses the Meta's push notification service.

You can choose which implementation to use with the `quest` / `mobile` build variants. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details. This makes it compatible with Meta Horizon devices, while remaining a drop-in replacement for `expo-notifications` on Android and iOS.

## Prerequisites

- Expo SDK 54 or later (`expo` package version 54.0.13+).
- `expo-horizon-core` package installed. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details.

## Usage

1. Install the `expo-horizon-core` package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-horizon-core
```

2. Install the package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-horizon-notifications

# and remove the old package:
npm uninstall expo-notifications
# or
yarn remove expo-notifications
```

3. Update your `app.json` / `app.config.js` to replace `expo-notifications` with `expo-horizon-notifications`.
4. Use the `questDebug` / `questRelease` build variants to run the app on Meta Quest devices. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details.
5. Update your imports:

```js
// import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-horizon-notifications';
```

## Behavior

- On Meta Quest devices ‚Üí Uses the Meta Horizon‚Äìcompatible push notification service.
- On standard Android devices ‚Üí Falls back to the default `expo-notifications` behavior using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- On iOS it should have no effect; behavior is always the same as `expo-notifications`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `quest` build variants are intended specifically for Meta Quest devices. Using them on standard Android devices is not recommended, as certain features may be unsupported or behave differently.

## Additional features

You might need additional features like `isHorizonDevice` or `isHorizonBuild` to check if the device is a Meta Horizon device. See [expo-horizon-core](../expo-horizon-core/README.md) for more details.

## Features supported on Meta Horizon OS

## Version compatibility

Our goal is to align the version numbers of `expo-horizon-notifications` and `expo-notifications` for easier upgrades. However, since this fork is still under development, we are currently using a separate versioning scheme.

| `expo-horizon-notifications` | `expo-notifications` |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0.0.7                        | 19.0.7               |
